                        <p>During my time at AuCom, I worked as an IT consultant where I was responsible for assembling and preparing PCs for installation. 
                            I imaged the computers with a tailored version of Windows, 
                            ensuring they had the necessary security updates and configurations suited for the company’s needs. 
                            Additionally, I helped set up networks and installed these PCs at SABC.</p>
                        <p>After the deployment, I continued to provide IT support for these systems, troubleshooting any issues that arose and ensuring smooth operation. 
                            My role required a hands-on approach, from assembling hardware to providing on-site technical assistance.</p>
