      <h1>Thane Diamond</h1>
      <h2>Who Am I?</h2>     
        <p>I'm a 22-year-old from Pretoria, currently finishing my diploma in IT — hopefully with your support.</p>

        <p>I built this website to showcase my CV and projects in one convenient place. Consider it a hub where you can find everything about me and what I’ve worked on.</p>

        <h2>What Have I Been Working On?</h2>
        <p>Recently, I've been developing a small app that connects to a database and allows CRUD operations. I've also explored various languages and worked on projects, some of which are still works in progress.</p>

        <h3>Feel free ot navigate to the other portals with the Nav bar up above</h3>
        <p>Or scroll to see some of my favourite things ^^</p>
